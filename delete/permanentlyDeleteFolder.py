"""
--NOTE--
This script is a working example of how you might permanently delete content, it is not recommended that you permanently delete data
without testing and confirming it's what you want to do. You can not undo this. You can not recover the permanently deleted data.
Script runs in 'testmode' unless you edit the script to do otherwise. 
Run at your own risk!

--> Folders with more than 5000 files in it will not be deleted. 
--> Folders with sub-folders that couldn't be deleted won't be deleted. 
--> logfile.txt is where console/print commands are placed. 
--> Report.csv is where details of folders and what was deleted or not. 

--WHAT DOES SCRIPT DO?--
This script iterates through a csv list, each line represents a member of a team. For each member uses the 
provided path given as the starting point to delete the folder and all sub-folders/files from Team Members account. 

CSV file should be called 'config.csv' listing out on separate rows the email address of each team 
member followed by the path of the folder to be deleted.
  e.g. 
  example.user@company.com,/marketing/internal assets
  another.user@company.com,/archive/videos

NOTE:
In example above the folder "/marketing" is not deleted, nor are files within that folder. Only folder "/internal assets"
      and it's sub folders/files are deleted. Same applies to example /archive.

If you do not provide a list, or the list is empty, the script will end. 
If you provide a path of /, which is the Dropbox root, the script will skip that user assuming a mistake has occurred
and will not destroy an entire account's content. 

As this could be a VERY slow process you are prompted to confirm your choice under this circumstance.

Outputted file is 'report.csv' pre-fixed with date and time. 

It has the following column headers:
  Folder Path: Path to a folder within or the path specified in source CSV file itself. 
  Number of folders: Number of sub-folders one level below the path ( does not include sum of subsequent sub-folders )
  Number of files: Number of files one level below the path ( does not include sum of subsequent sub-folders )
  Total size in Folder structure: Total volume of information below this path structure
  Total bytes in folder structure: Total volume of information below this path structure in bytes
  File size in folder: Total volume of files in the path ( does not include sum of subsequent sub-folders  )
  File bytes in folder: Total volume of files in the path in bytes
  Path Deleted: Where we able to delete the path?

--REQUIREMENTS--
  Script written testing on Python 2.7.10

  Two Dropbox API Tokens are needed, insert just below this comments section.
  * Team Member File Access
  * Team Member Management

--PRE-REQUISITES--
  * Script requires library 'requests' to make API calls. Navigate to python scripts folder e.g. c:\Python27\Scripts
  * Then run command "pip install requests"
  Note: if experiencing issues installing libraries try append " --user" to end of each pip command

--TO DO--
  * Set your Team Member Management token
  * Set your Team Member File Access token
  * Create a file called 'config.csv' in same folder as this script, add member emails and folder to PERMANENTLY delete.
