********************************************************************************************************************
The intention of this script is to:
Iterate through a list of users ( users.csv ), remove that member from the source team (based on the API token provided gFromTeamTOKEN) 
returning their account to being a personal individual account. 
Then immediately inviting the user to join new team (based on the API token provided gToTeamTOKEN).

NOTE:
  CSV file expects email, first name, last name
  One user per row

Users in target Team are invited as standard team members. These users will need to ACCEPT the invitation before joining the team.
Once they accept, they will enter the invite flow, and must select option to transfer their content to company.
If you need to promote anyone to an Administrative level, do so using the Admin web pages.

NOTES:
  When you remove a team member from a team:
  1. Account will be disconnected from the team and converted to an individual account
  2. Member will keep unshared files and folders, and shared folders that they own
  3. Member won't have access to team-owned folders that they were invited to after joining the team 
  4. Member will still have access to Paper docs that they own and are private. They will lose access to paper documents that were
     shared with them, and also paper documents they owned and shared with others!

By default the script runs in MOCK or test mode. Edit the variable 'gMockRun' to make it run for real.
By default adding users to target team will send them an invite email, edit variable 'gSendWelcomeEmail' to stop this.
Script logs most console content to a file 'logfile.txt' in the location script is executed. 

** WARNING **
If you enter incorrect Target Team Token, users accounts could be orphaned as they'll be removed from Source Team but not added to
the Target Team. 


Requirements:
  Script tested on Python 3.6.5

  One Dropbox API Token is needed from each team, source team and target team. Inserted just below this comments section.
  Permissions needed on token:

  Source Team:
  - team_data.member    "View structure of your team's and members' folders"
  - members.delete        "Remove and recover your team members' accounts"

  Target Team:
  - team_data.member    "View structure of your team's and members' folders"
  - members.write        "View and manage your team membership"


Pre-requisites:
* Scripts requires library 'Requests' - You can install using "pip install requests"
